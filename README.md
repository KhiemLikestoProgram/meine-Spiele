# Impromptu
It's just a normal console "app" (with search and many other features that I developed only in Python. I'll learn others next month.
## What this does:
- IDK
##
## Why do I stuck here?
- What? I thought this was a private repo...
OK then, you can follow along.
##
## Hmmm... Why does the file's name is "impromptu.exe"?
- It's because I don't have the plan for this project (you think it's a bad respond? but I'm a pre-teen!!!)
